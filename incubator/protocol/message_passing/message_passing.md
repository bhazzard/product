# Message passing between execution instances

This document describes a proposed [change to the EOSIO protocol](../README.md) to introduce the new concepts around execution of contract code and the communication between contracts.

## Dependencies on other protocol features

None

## Benefits

* More modular contracts.
* Enables better designed contract APIs that can be used by other contracts.
* Lays sensible foundation for good contract standards and greater generality and flexibility in the evolution of the EOSIO protocol.
* Introduces fundamental mechanism of breaking up computation in a manner that can later lead to parallelization of contract code execution.
